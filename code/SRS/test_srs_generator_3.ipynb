      "2. **Book Management**: Users should be able to add or remove books without restrictions; the ability to permanently delete a purchased/downloaded ebook must remain functional within the app settings where deletions are not immediately visible on devices but persist in libraries and iCloud backups for restoration (Functionality).\n",
      "3. **Purchase Integration**: The system should provide clear confirmation of purchase statuses, ensuring that all books purchased through a linked account like Apple's App Store or Kindle Unlimited are accurately reflected as 'Free'. In addition to this, the app must allow for easy access and management within iTunes (Functionality).\n",
      "4. **Error Handling**: The system should handle errors gracefully without displaying error codes directly in the user interface; instead, it shall provide meaningful feedback guiding users through resolution steps or alternatives when a book cannot be found during download attempts post-backup (Functionality & Usability).\n",
      "5. **Message Delivery and Recovery**: The system must reliably deliver messages to recipients without fail while ensuring that undelivered messages are accounted for in the last backup, with an option provided within settings to restore or retry delivery of these emails where necessary (Functionality & Reliability).\n",
      "6. **Bookshelf Interface**: The system shall include a customizable bookshelf interface allowing users to personalize colors and backgrounds that are visually appealing while maintaining ease-of-use for navigation within the app, including tapping/swiping gestures (Usability & Design Constraints).\n",
      "7. **File Transfer**: The system must include a clear mechanism indicating when transferring music files is not possible due to file size limitations and provide an intuitive pathway forward without causing user frustration or confusion during the process of sending content between users within iBooks (Usability & Performance Requirements).\n",
      "8. **Call Quality**: The system should ensure clear voice communication quality, suggesting a review for potential audio enhancement in calls to maintain clarity and prevent any issues related to call disru07/2023 \n",

      "# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for iBooks Enhancement Project\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction and Purpose:\n",
      "This document outlines a comprehensive set of requirements to enhance user experience with Apple's e-reading app, iBooks, based on the classified feedback. The purpose is to address critical issues reported by users regarding functionality, appearance, compatibility, performance, and overall satisfaction while striving for an intuitive design that emulates a traditional library setting without compromising modern usability standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "## System Overview:\n",
      "The iBooks application (IBooks) serves as the primary e-reading platform on Apple devices designed to store, organize, read and manage digital books seamlessly across iOS 6 or later versions supported by compatible hardware such as iPhone, iPad, Mac, and specifically for users with Android tablets running at least one of these system requirements:\n",
      "- Operating System (OS) version must be iOS 8.0 or higher due to compatibility issues reported in the feedback.\n",
      "- The app should function optimally on devices that support Apple Pencil input when available as some interactions are enhanced with this feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Functional Requirements:\n",
      "1. **Book Download and Storage**: Users must be able to download books without encountering errors or being misled about pricing (e.g., a book marked \"free\" should not charge the user). Books downloaded for free are expected to remain accessible within iBooks, with no need for repeated attempts that can lead to failure in finding them.\n",
      "2. **Library Navigation**: Users must be able to navigate their library easily and efficiently using standard tapping gestures and swiping actions without encountering hidden books or issues accessing the edit button due to constant loading times (e.g., spinning circles). The ability to permanently delete unwanted e-books should remain functional, with clear indications of deletion status for each book.\n",
      "3. **Book Collections**: Users must be able to create and manage collections within iBooks as a way to organize their digital library effectively without encountering issues in the process or system errors during backup operations related to these actions (e.g., last/last-backup not found).\n",
      "4. **Audio File Integration**: The app should provide clear audio playback with no distortion, and users must be able to send music files between contacts without encountering size limitations that prevent file delivery due to exceeded MB limits or unexpected errors during transmission within the application interface (e.g., messages not getting delivered).\n",
      "5. **Contact Messaging**: The system should ensure reliable message delivery with no undeliverable state, and users must be able to add contacts without issues in delivering sent messages post-update.\n",
      "6. **Book Purchasing Options**: Users need a straightforward way to purchase books directly within the app while ensuring accurate pricing information is displayed for each title (e.g., prevent misleading price representations).\n",
      "7. **Application Management**: The ability to manage and update iBooks should not require frequent deletion of stored content, with an understanding that users may want or need permanent removal options without recurring issues in the app's settings manager interface.\n",
      "8. **Backup Functionality**: Users must have a reliable backup system for their e-books within iBooks to prevent data loss and ensure backups are successfully created on devices with sufficient storage capacity, avoiding incomplete or failed restores after updates (e.g., issues related to last/last backup not found).\n",
      "9. **Compatibility**: The app should maintain compatibility across supported iOS versions without encountering errors that may arise from system upgrades and ensure stable performance for all compatible hardware devices including Android tablets with the appropriate OS version, if applicable in future updates (e.g., ios 6 is not currently supported).\n",
      "10. **Call Quality**: Users must experience clear voice transmission during calls within iBooks without any quality degradation or lag that interrupts communication flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-Functional Requirements:\n",
      "The system should offer a user interface with an appealing and non-disruptive design, including the option to revert back to previous designs (e.g., wooden bookshelf) for nostalgic preference without compromising modern standards of usability or accessibility across devices like iPads Mini running iOS 6 on older hardware models where applicable in future updates if supported by Apple's compatibility policy decisions.\n",
      "1. **User Interface**: The app must have an aesthetically pleasing design, offering both the traditional wooden bookshelf look and modern clean interfaces to cater to user nostalgia while maintaining intuitive navigation for ease of use across different device types (e.g., iPads Mini).\n",
      "2. **Performance**: The app should exhibit high responsiveness with minimal loading times, ensuring that the system remains snappy and non-blocky without causing delays or constant redownload attempts due to performance issues such as spinning circles when accessing certain functionalities (e.g., book downloads).\n",
      "3. **Compatibility**: The app should provide consistent functionality across all supported devices, ensuring no hardware limitations impede the user experience and that compatibility with older iOS versions is maintained where necessary for a seamless transition from legacy to newer systems without significant disruption or errors (e.g., ios 6).\n",
      "4. **Interoperability**: The app must maintain backward compatibility when sending audio files between contacts, ensuring no issues arise due to hardware differences among devices and that the system remains robust in handling multimedia content across varying screen sizes/formats without causing crashes or errors (e.g., music file delivery).\n",
      "5. **User Satisfaction**: The app should consistently deliver a high level of user satisfaction, measured through metrics like Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer feedback ratings on ease-of-use, content availability accuracy, audio quality during calls, backup reliability, pricing transparency for purchases within the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Performance Requirements:\n",
      "The system must maintain a stable performance across all devices with compatible hardware without encountering frequent crashes or errors post updates (e.g., ios 6 not supported). The app should operate smoothly on iOS versions as high as possible, avoiding compatibility issues that can disrupt the user experience and lead to loss of data integrity in backups after system upgrades.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Security Requirements:\n",
      "1. **Data Privacy**: Personal contact information must be securely managed within iBooks with no unauthorized access or leaks, ensuring that messages sent through the app are encrypted and remain private between contacts (e.g., issues related to undeliverable state of sent audio files).\n",
      "2. **Pricing Accuracy**: The pricing information for books must be accurate as reported within iBooks without misrepresentation, ensuring users do not encounter unexpected charges or incorrect price displays after updates that may affect their financial transactions (e.g., a book marked \"free\" should remain free).\n",
      "3. **Backup Integrity**: The backup system in the app must ensure data integrity and reliability for user e-books across different hardware devices, with no failures to restore backups or issues related to last/last-backup not found occurring after updates (e.g., failed restores).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compatibility Requirements: \n",
      "1. **Hardware Support**: The app must be compatible and fully functional across all supported hardware devices, ensuring that the system remains stable even with older models of iPads Mini running iOS versions as high as possible (e.g., ios6). This includes maintaining backward compatibility where necessary without compromising on modern UI/UX standards for new users while respecting user preferences in design nostalgia when available and compatible across all supported devices.\n",
      "2. **OS Version Support**: The app must support the latest iOS version (iOS 8.0+) with a graceful degradation of functionality where necessary, ensuring that older versions like ios6 do not impede usage for users who still operate on legacy systems if future updates permit compatibility enhancements by Apple without significant disruption or errors in functionalities such as purchasing and managing book collections (e.g., creating a seamless experience during system upgrades).\n",
      "3. **Audio File Transmission**: The app should ensure clear, uninterrupted voice transmission across calls within iBooks regardless of the hardware used by users to maintain communication quality without distortion or lag on any compatible device (e.g., no issues with sending music files between contacts due to size limitations).\n",
