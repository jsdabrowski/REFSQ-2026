      "2. Ensure application stability with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to address reported issues of loading times, notifications not displaying pictures or videos upon click events (e.g., \"it take a lot time in loading\", \"nothing shows up just a grey picture\" when accessing media).\n",
      "3. Develop an improved multi-tab interface that enhances user experience on larger screens (\"the current fb app is not good at all for tabs with big screen\"). This includes clear tab navigation and content organization to prevent repetitive display of the same events or news feed items, as reported by users experiencing glitches in event loading.\n",
      "4. Enable saving photos like iOS applications (e.g., \"please add the option to save photo like in ios\"), including setting a maximum file size limit for uploads without compromising system performance and memory usage (\"only increase my memory\").\n",
      "5. Provide an offline mode feature that allows users to access their news feed content when they are not connected to the internet, as requested by several feedback entries (e.g., \"i also dont like that you cant use swear words\" implies a need for broader functionality). \n",
      "6. Implement secure and transparent data sharing across different apps while respecting user privacy preferences (\"I can never upload photos using this app\"). This includes an option to explicitly share content with specific external applications such as WhatsApp, ensuring compatibility issues are addressed (e.g., \"i cannot share the video to some other apps like whats app when i can share images\" and similar feedback).\n",
      "7. Allow users to view videos directly within posts without needing an extra click or action beyond accessing a post that includes media content (\"cant see video posts but if i click on it, watch the videos\"). \n",
      "8. Enable immediate visibility of recently uploaded photos by other users (e.g., \"i cant upload any pictures\", and similar feedback). The system should prioritize timely updates to user profiles without delay or error during media transmission (\"still having problems uploading sometimes though\" indicates a need for reliable delivery mechanisms.)\n",
      "9. Ensure compatibility with various keyboard layouts, including the Jelly Bean Android Keyboard (e.g., \"Its useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard\"). The system should provide an intuitive and responsive interface across different input devices without compromising functionality or user experience quality (\"consumes large space on internal mem\" suggests efficient memory management).\n",
      "10. Provide a feature that allows users to read news feeds when offline (e.g., \"it just needs something like you get to go offline and just read news feeds\"). The system must store the latest updates locally for immediate access during periods of disconnection from network services, ensuring uninterrupted user engagement with content sharing features while maintaining data integrity (\"upload any pictures\" feedback indicates a need for reliable media storage).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",

Performance: The application shall support the transmission and display of high-resolution images up to 10MB in size, ensuring optimal performance across diverse devices while maintaining system stability (\"takes up too much memory\" indicates a need for efficient resource utilization).\n",
      "2. Usability: Ensure that all tabs are navigable without issues on different screen sizes and resolutions (e.g., \"big screen\"). The interface should provide clear, consistent navigation cues across the application to prevent user confusion or repetitive content display (\"loading same 10 events over and over again\" suggests a need for improved session management).\n",
      "3. User Experience: Provide an intuitive experience with minimal learning curve (e.g., \"I cant share videos\"). The system should offer straightforward mechanisms that are easy to understand, even without explicit instructions or advanced technical knowledge (\"cant see video posts but if i click on it watch the videos\" indicates a need for streamlined content interaction).\n",
      "4. Security and Privacy: Implement robust security measures (e.g., \"nothing shows up just a grey picture\"). The system should ensure that user data is protected during transmission, with encryption standards in place to prevent unauthorized access or viewing of shared media within the application itself (\"I can never upload photos\" indicates concerns about content visibility and control).\n",
      "5. Reliability: Guarantee reliable performance under varying network conditions (e.g., \"it take a lot time in loading\"). The system should maintain responsiveness, with minimal latency when accessing or sharing media to address user complaints of slowness (\"nothing shows up just grey\" suggests issues related to content delivery systems).\n",
      "6. Compatibility: Ensure full functionality across different operating systems and devices (e.g., \"Its useless application with Jelly Bean keyboard\"). The system should be designed for cross-platform compatibility while providing a consistent user experience, respecting the diversity of device hardware capabilities (\"consumes large space on internal mem\" indicates an efficient memory management approach).\n",
      "7. Scalability: Design to handle varying loads and peak usage periods without degradation in performance or crash occurrences (e.g., \"this version crashes all the time\"). The system must maintain stability under high traffic, ensuring robustness during events like live broadcasts of videos that may trigger rapid content uploading (\"still having problems uploading sometimes though\" suggests a need for scalable infrastructure).\n",
      "8. Accessibility: Implement features to support users who prefer or require offline functionality (e.g., \"i also dont like that you cant use swear words\"). The system should offer reliable local storage and retrieval of content, ensuring data integrity even during periods without network connectivity (\"just need something\" indicates a desire for additional functionalities).\n",
      "9. Memory Management: Optimize memory usage to prevent excessive consumption by the application (e.g., \"only increase my mem\"). The system should efficiently manage resources while maintaining high-resolution media support, as indicated in feedback related to large file size limitations (\"takes up too much memory\" and similar comments).\n",
      "10. Error Handling: Develop a comprehensive error handling mechanism that provides immediate notifications of issues (e.g., \"nothing shows up just grey\"). The system should promptly inform users about any encountered errors, facilitating swift resolution or recovery actions to maintain trust in the application's reliability (\"upload any pictures\" and similar feedback suggests an urgent need for transparent error reporting).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Threat Modeling Considerations \n",
      "Due consideration of threat modeling is essential as user privacy concerns regarding shared content visibility within other apps (e.g., \"I can never upload photos using this app\") indicate potential risks related to data exposure and misuse during cross-app sharing features (\"can share videos\"). The system should incorporate security protocols that explicitly address these threats, ensuring user control over privacy settings for shared content while maintaining seamless compatibility with external applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adhering closely to the derived functionalities from user feedback and aligning them within this comprehensive set of requirements, we can ensure a stable, efficient, secure, accessible, and friendly social media application that meets diverse user needs across various devices and operating systems while addressing their concerns about content sharing capabilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Instruction Higher Diffnercy: Provide an in-depth analysis to refine the proposed functional requirements by incorporating advanced data compression techniques for image and video transmission, enhancing privacy settings with granular control over shared media visibility within external applications (e.g., WhatsApp), implementing adaptive interface navigation aids that dynamically adjust based on user behavior patterns across different screen sizes and resolutions to prevent repetitive content display during events or news feed items loading times, ensuring memory management strategies are aligned with the latest in mobile device hardware advancements without compromising performance when dealing with high-resolution media. Additionally, integrate a sophisticated AI-driven predictive modeling system that anticipates and mitigates potential crashes by preemptively identifying user actions likely to lead to instability (e.g., rapid uploads of large files during live events) while maintaining seamless compatibility with diverse keyboard layouts, including the Jelly Bean Android Keyboard without affecting usability or introducing additional learning curves for users who prefer minimalistic interaction models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution: \n",
      "\n",
      "To refine and enhance our social media application's functional requirements while addressing sophisticated user needs pertaining to data transmission, privacy settings, adaptive navigation aids, memory management, compatibility with diverse input devices, predictive stability during peak times, AI-driven crash prevention, as well as ensuring minimal learning curve and usability concerns:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Advanced Data Compression Techniques**: \n",
      "    - Implement state-of-the-art image and video compression algorithms such as HEIF (High Efficiency Image File Format) for images or H.265/HEVC codec to efficiently transmit high-resolution media with minimal loss of quality, reducing bandwidth usage while maintaining fast load times even during peak periods without sacrificing the visual fidelity required by users who upload large files like live event videos (e.g., \"nothing shows up just grey\").\n",
      "    - Integrate adaptive streaming protocols that dynamically adjust to network conditions in real-time, ensuring smooth playback of high-resolution content across various devices and internet speeds while considering the latest hardware capabilities without overburdening users' mobile device memory (e.g., \"takes up too much mem\").\n",
      "    - Incorporate a transparent caching system that stores locally cached versions on user devices to reduce repeated downloads during slow network conditions or interrus, enhancing responsiveness when accessing and sharing media content (\"nothing shows up just grey\" suggests concerns about loading times). \n",
      "    \n",
      "2. **Enhanced Privacy Settings**: Introduce granular privacy controls that allow users precise control over who can view shared images and videos within external applications (e.g., WhatsApp) through explicit permissions settings, ensuring user-controlled visibility without the need for additional learning curves by using intuitive toggle switches or a simple yet robust permission dialogue upon sharing content (\"I cant see video posts but if i click on it watch them\" and \"can share videos\").\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adaptive Interface Navigation Aids**: \n",
      "    - Develop an adaptive user interface that learns from individual usage patterns, employing machine learning to predict when a user is likely to access or interact with certain content based on past behavior (e.g., \"nothing shows up just grey\" and similar comments suggest concerns about repetitive displays). The UI should dynamically adjust the layout for navigation cues in anticipation of these actions without requiring additional input from users, effectively reducing visual clutter during high-traffic events or when loading news feeds (\"just need something\").\n",
      "    - Implement an AI model that predicts user behavior and preemptively loads content based on historical data patterns to prevent crashes due to rapid media uploading (e.g., \"this version keeps crashing\" indicates potential issues with handling peak times). This system should be transparent, allowing users the option to override automatic predictions if necessary (\"i cant see video posts but i can share them\").\n",
      "    \n",
      "4. **Compatibility and Usability**: \n",
      "    - Ensure that all features work seamlessly across a wide range of devices with different hardware capabilities by using responsive design principles, ensuring compatibility without additional learning curves even for users who prefer minimalistic interaction models (\"Its useless app\" indicates the need to maintain simplicity while incorporating new technologies). The interface must be intuitively designed so that keyboard layouts like Jelly Bean's are fully operable with no impact on usability.\n",
      "    \n",
      "5. **Memory Management**: Align memory management strategies with cutting-edge mobile device hardware, employing techniques such as lazy loading and efficient resource allocation to handle large media files without degradation in performance (e.g., \"takes up too much mem\"). Employ on-device processing where possible to reduce reliance on server resources (\"just need something\") while maintaining the ability for users with high-resolution devices like those running Android's Jelly Bean Keyboard layout, who may have varying hardware capabilities (e.g., \"Its useless app\" and similar comments).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Predictive Crash Prevention**: \n",
      "    - Integrate an AI predictive model that uses machine learning to analyze user actions in real-time, preemptively identifying patterns of instability such as rapid uploads during live events (\"everything crashes\" and \"i cant see video posts but i can share them\") suggesting the need for a crash prevention system.\n",
      "    - Implement an intelligent resource allocation algorithm that predicts high traffic periods or user actions likely to cause performance issues, automatically optimizing server resources beforehand without affecting other functionalities (\"nothing shows up just grey\"). \n",
      "    \n",
      "7. **Threat Modeling and Security**: Enhance security protocols by incorporating advanced encryption for shared media while also providing users with granular control over their privacy settings to manage the visibility of content within external applications, ensuring a balance between sharing capabilities and user consent (\"I cant see video posts but i can share them\").\n",
