      "3. Users should not be subjected to excessive notifications, and these must accurately reflect the most recent activities within their network of friends as reported in feedback about misleading updates displaying old posts atop news feeds when new ones are selected. \n",
      "\n",
      "## System Features\n",
      "- Instant photo viewing on feed after upload without display errors or random picture changes (e.g., 'Select a different pic').\n",
      "- Comment deletion functionality for personal walls, not just likes as reported in feedback requesting this feature from other users and the system itself.\n",
      "- Fitbit integration to show calorie tracking alongside physical activity data within social interactions on feeds or status updates (e.g., 'My new Fitbit is so amazing'). \n",
      "- Notification improvement for relevant, real-time friend activities without redundancy as reported in feedback about notifications still showing outdated posts and spammy ads popping up uninvitedly during regular use of the app.\n",
      "- Voice input functionality to facilitate typing URLs into text messages (e.g., 'Voice Typing' or similar). \n",
      "\n",
      "## User Interface Requirements\n",
      "The system must maintain a fast load time for updates on news feeds, ensuring that users can access their friends’ activities without any noticeable lag as reported in feedback about the current app freezing and hanging. The interface shall be designed to minimize network requests while optimizing data usage through efficient caching mechanisms (e.g., 'Fast Load Time for Feed Updates').\n",
      "\n",
      "## Security Requirements \n",
      "- All user interactions, such as friend approvals or likes/dislikes on status updates and comments, must be securely authenticated to prevent unauthorized access without causing additional prompts (e.g., 'No more unexpected force closures' indicating possible security issues in feedback).\n",
      "- User data privacy should be maintained with appropriate consent management for friend activity tracking as reported by users concerned about their activities being tracked and displayed on feeds or status updates regarding friends’ fitness progress, such as calorie intake/burn (e.g., 'Fitbit integration'). \n",

      "\n",
      "## Your task: Based on the above requirements, create a comprehensive plan to improve user experience and functionality of this social networking app while addressing all identified issues in feedback using UML diagrams for system architecture and sequence charts where necessary. Ensure that your solution includes detailed specifications regarding how each requirement will be implemented technically with clear references to potential algorithms or data structures used, without directly quoting the original text but paraphrasing it into a structured format suitable for an engineering team's review document. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Solution 1: Based on user feedback and system requirements provided above, here is how we can address each requirement in detail with technical specifications using UML diagrams where necessary (please note that actual drawing of the diagrams cannot be done textually):\n",
      "\n",
      "### User Experience Improvements for Instant Photo Viewing:\n",
      "- **Requirement 1** and **9** need an efficient image loading mechanism. We'll implement a lazy loading approach with caching to ensure images load instantly without errors or random changes when selected from the feed, using AJAX requests combined with WebSockets for real-time updates (UML Sequence Diagram).\n",
      "- Implementing 'Select Different Pic’ error handling will be managed by introducing an image validation feature that confirms if a user has uploaded photos before displaying them on their timeline. If not, the app should default to showing recent uploads or prompt users accordingly with clear messaging (UML Activity Diagram).\n",
      "- For Fitbit integration and calorie tracking display within social interactions in feeds, we'll create an API call that retrieves activity data from the user’s connected fitness device via OAuth2.0 authentication before displaying it on their feed or status updates to maintain privacy (UML Use Case Diagram).\n",
      "- A dedicated 'Voice Typing' functionality can be implemented using a speech recognition library like Google Cloud Speech API, which converts spoken words into text input for URLs in messages within the app. This feature will reduce manual typing and enhance user experience significantly without forced space insertion after periods (UML Activity Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Non-Functional Requirements: Battery Optimization & User Experience Improvements:\n",
      "- To optimize battery life, we'll implement a background service that periodically fetches feed updates at user-defined intervals rather than polling every time the app is opened. This will be achieved using WorkManager in Android with an optimally scheduled job (UML Activity Diagram).\n",
      "- The notification system will employ smart algorithms like Last Recent First or Least recently used to prioritize recent activities, ensuring notifications only display relevant and timely updates without unnecessary repetition (UML Sequence Chart for Notifications Processing). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Technical Specification: System Architecture & Data Structures\n",
      "- Implement an in-memory cache using a data structure like Redis to store recently viewed photos temporarily, reducing the number of network requests needed upon each feed access. This will also help with instant photo viewing (UML Component Diagram). \n",
      "- User activity tracking for friends' interactions without redundancy or outdated content requires an efficient database query that sorts and retrieves only new posts by timestamp before displaying them on news feeds, using a proper indexing mechanism like B+ Trees to keep the data sorted in real time (UML Class Diagram). \n",
      "- For security concerns regarding friend activity tracking with Fitbit integration: We'll use secure tokens for each user session and ensure that all API calls are authenticated via OAuth2.0, ensuring only authorized users can access their respective friends’ data while maintaining a privacy layer (UML Component Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "### System Security & Data Privacy: \n",
      "- All friend interactions will be encrypted using AES encryption before sending to the server and then decrypted on our secure backend environment, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their friends' data. This process is visualized in a UML Activity Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compatibility with Huawei Devices: \n",
      "- Implement native Android SDKs for caching capabilities to ensure backward compatibility and seamless integration across all supported devices within the ecosystem (UML Component Diagram depicting cross-platform functionality highlighted in green, while non-supported platforms are notified of this limitation).\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Documentation: This comprehensive plan addresses each user feedback point with specific technical solutions. The UML diagrams would be created to represent the system architecture and activity flows for these features but cannot actually draw here due to textual format constraints, so I'll describe them instead as requested components that could visualize this solution (e.0rganized list of improvements):\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lazy Loading & Caching:** Implement AJAX requests with a caching mechanism and WebSockets for real-time updates using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to handle asynchronous data retrieval from the server, reducing load times while maintaining instantaneous feed loading. A cache invalidation strategy will be in place when new photos are uploaded by friends or after specific time intervals.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fitbit Integration & Activity Tracking:** API calls using OAuth2.0 for secure access to Fitbit data, with user consent and token expiration/refresh mechanisms (UML Sequence Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "- For the 'Voice Typing' feature, Google Cloud Speech Recognition APIs will be used as a backbone technology choice that integrates seamlessly into our existing messaging system. A fallback to manual entry for non-speech input is provided (UML Activity Diagram). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Instruction with Added Complexity: Increase the difficulty by adding at least five more constraints, including specific algorithms or data structures and a unique constraint regarding user permissions that must be respected in your response. Additionally, ensure to discuss how these changes will affect system performance (with time complexity considerations) while maintaining secure coding practices for handling sensitive information such as calorie tracking without storing it on the device itself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instruction 2: What if... \n",
      "\n",
      "Assume that each user has different levels of permissions based on their subscription tier, with 'Premium' users having access to all features and regular users only accessing public content. How would you modify your plan? To address this enhanced scenario where the app must handle varying permission levels for Premium vs Regular subscribers concerning activity tracking:\n",
      "\n",
      "- All of a sudden we need an additional layer that differentiates between 'Premium' (full access) and 'Regular' users in terms of permissions. This means implementing role-based user authentication to verify membership status before granting any data retrieval from the Fitbit API, ensuring only authenticated Premium members can view their friends’ fitness activities on feeds or within status updates while regulars see a summary (UML Use Case Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instruction 2: Improve user experience by providing personalized notifications for users based on the time of day and activity levels, using machine learning to predict which posts might interest them. Describe how this feature would be integrated into your plan with an algorithm that takes historical data patterns without compromising privacy (UML Component Diagram). \n",
      "\n",
      "### Solution 2: To enhance user experience by personalizing notifications based on time of day and activity level, we'll implement a machine learning model using Python’incorporating TensorFlow or PyTorch to analyze historical data patterns. The algorithm will predict the most relevant posts for each individual (UML Component Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      "- A lightweight recommendation engine that uses clustering algorithms like k-means on user activity times and types of activities tracked, ensuring minimal performance impact by running this analysis during off-peak hours using a background service in Android. Notifications will be prioritized based on the time (UML Activity Diagram).\n",
      "- We'll integrate TensorFlow Lite for mobile devices to run lightweight models efficiently and ensure real-time data processing with limited resources, respecting user privacy by anonymizing personally identifiable information before sending out notifications. A differentially encrypted hash of activity levels will be used (UML Class Diagram).\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Documentation: This solution requires careful consideration for performance optimization due to the potential increase in computational complexity and resource usage; hence, we'll use a micro-optimized model with an efficient algorithm like k-means clustering that can run on mobile devices. The system will maintain high fidelity while ensuring no sensitive data is stored locally (UML Sequence Diagram). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instruction: What if... \n",
      "\n",
      "Can you provide a detailed plan for integrating voice recognition to identify the user's physical activity levels and tailor notifications accordingly? Describe how this feature would be incorporated into your system while ensuring GDPR compliance in terms of data usage (UML Activity Diagram). Additionally, include an approach that minimizes false positives/negatives for such personalized recommendations. \n",

      "### Solution to Instruction 2: To integrate voice recognition with activity tracking and notifications without compromising user privacy or performance on low-end devices while adhering to GDPR compliance (UML Activity Diagram). We'll use a lightweight neural network model for speech analysis, which will be pretrained using TensorFlow Lite. The algorithm operates locally with minimal latency and requires no more than 5 seconds of audio sampling time on the device without affecting battery life significantly; it should not exceed this threshold (UML Sequence Diagram).\n",

      "### Instruction: Implement a multi-lingual support system for users who want to log their calorie intake, requiring an additional layer in your design that can handle various languages and dialects. Explain how you would incorporate natural language processing techniques like sentiment analysis or NLP (Natural Language Processing) based on the user’s voice tone and pitch detection algorithms to gauge emotional state from audio inputs for empathetic responses, as well as a method of logging these data points in real-time without storing personal health information. Describe how this will be reflected within your system design while ensuring compliance with HIPAA regulations (UML Use Case Diagram). \n",

      "   \n",
      "4. **Interaction Features**: Users should have capabilities for commenting, liking statuses of others and sharing content without restrictions between friends or publicly with appropriate privacy controls in place; however, the ability to delete comments from one's own wall is missing (new feature request) - this deletion option must be implemented.\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. **Connection Check**: The system should not prompt users for a connection check when they have full signal bars before posting status updates or sharing content but instead only under network issues as determined by the feedback received from various devices and operating systems (iOS, Android). This will enhance user experience in stable conditions with good connectivity.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. **Notification System**: The notification system should accurately reflect new posts/statuses without delay or ad pop-ups; notifications must be clear regarding updates on friends' statuses when most recent is selected (improve current issues based on feedback).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Status Deletion and Editing**: Users need the option to delete their own comments from a post, which currently does not exist - this feature should also allow for editing of previously posted content without affecting other users' interactions with it if necessary (new user request consideration).\n",
      "   \n",
      "8. **External Interface Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility and consistent performance across iOS and Android platforms; include the option to save photos like in native iOS apps, as requested by some users for added convenience when accessing their device without an internet connection or using a nook with iPad (new feature request).\n",
      "   \n",
      "9. **Battery Usage**: Avoid features that disproportionately consume battery life on devices; ads should not be displayed to the user unless necessary, as per feedback suggesting unnecessary advertisements are present and detracting from usability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
      "1. **Usability Standards**: The application must provide a keyboard replacement that is easy for users to type with on various devices; ensure it allows customization of the spacebar behavior (e.g., not inserting spaces after periods). \n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **User Interface and Experience**: Design should accommodate all feedback by ensuring notifications are timely, accurate in content delivery without ads when expected to be free from interrusences; user interface must remain simple yet functional for optimal mobile experience with character limits enforced on status updates. \n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Reliability and Stability**: The application should not cause the device or network to hang frequently nor exhibit frequent crashes, as reported by users experiencing these issues post-update (reliability requirement). Freezing up of apps must be addressed with stability in mind for consistent user experience across all devices.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Performance**: The system should ensure quick responsiveness when loading status updates and shared media within the news feed, achieving under 2 seconds as per feedback on current load times (perceived performance requirement). High-quality image alignment is necessary to avoid misalignment issues reported in recent update history.\n",
      "   \n",
      "5. **Scalability**: The application should support a growing number of users and media files without significant lag or loss in functionality, ensuring the 5MB photo/video size limit does not impede user interactions (scalability requirement). Users must have no more than two consecutive network errors when uploading content post-update.\n",
      "   \n",
      "6. **Compatibility**: The application should function correctly across different devices and operating systems with minimal to zero prompts for connection checks under stable conditions; the system's compatibility standard is high (compatibility requirement). \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Security & Privacy Controls**: Implement appropriate privacy controls allowing users to share content only among friends or publicly, respecting user preferences and ensuring no unintended data sharing with other apps as per feedback-derived feature request for enhanced security (security requirement). \n",
      "   \n",
      "8. **Performance Across Platforms**: The application should not cause the device's battery to drain excessively when using features like notifications, nor display ad pop-ups unless essential; additionally it must support saving photos locally on devices with no internet connection or while linked via an iPad (new feature request).\n",
      "   \n",
      "9. **Battery Efficiency**: The application should not consume more battery life than necessary for its operation and avoid unnecessary features like ads that do not contribute to the core functionality of status updates, comments, likes etc.; thus ensuring minimal impact on device performance (battery efficiency requirement).\n",
      "   \n",
      "1declaration \n",

      "Climate change significantly affects insect populations worldwide, but its effects extend beyond the obvious physical transformations in their habitats. The document reveals that these changes have altered feeding patterns of various organisms within an ecosystem and impacted predator-prey dynamics due to shifts in seasonal timing (phenological mismatches). Notably, climate change has led insects like beetles and butterflies to adapt their life cycles earlier or later than usual. This adaptation can lead them into unseasonable weather conditions that may disrupt the availability of resources such as food sources for birds and mammals who rely on these species (Brown, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "The study also highlights a concerning decline in insect biodiversity due to extreme temperature fluctinations. These changes have led organisms like bees that depend heavily on specific plants' flowering times for sustenance and reproduction into facing food shortages (Smith et al., 2019). Furthermore, it suggests the need for conservation efforts focusing not just on habitats but also genetic diversity to safeguard ecosystems from potential future changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document underscdems that insect populations are particularly sensitive indicators of climate change effects since their lifecycles and behaviors closely align with environmental cues like temperature, humidity levels, etc., which makes them excellent bioindicators (Jones et al., 2021). However, the complexity in these systems requires a comprehensive understanding to predict future impacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, it notes that butterfly species are particularly vulnerable due to their sensitivity towards temperature and precipitation changes which could lead them into disrupted life cycles (Davis et al., 2020). The study proposes conservation efforts for these insect populations as a priority in the face of climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, understanding how global warming affects ecological systems is essential to mitigate its impact on biodiversity and maintain balance within our planet's life forms (Lee et al., 2019). The study provides evidence that insect populations are more vulnerable than previously understood. It also emphasizes the importance of conservation efforts in ensuring a balanced ecosystem, which is vital for future studies to explore further into these complex dynamics and their implications on global biodiversity (Miller et al., 2018).\n",

      "Document: \"Insects are integral components of our ecosystem. Climate change has led to a marked increase in extreme weather events that disrupt the delicate balance within habitats, causing unprecedented changes across various trophic levels (Gomez et al., 2021). These environmental alterations have had profound effects on insect biodiversity and behavior. The study highlights how climate change can cause temporal mismatches between butterflies' life cycles and the blooming periods of their host plants, which may result in a decline in food resources for these critical pollinators (Hawkins et al., 2018). Such disrubotion affects not only insect populations themselves but also has significant repercussions on higher trophic levels that depend on them. As such changes continue to escalate, urgent conservation actions are needed for the preservation of these delicate creatures and their habitats (Miller et al., 2019).\"\n",

      "\"Climate change has been identified as one of the most significant threats facing insect populations worldwide, with its effects on biodiversity being profoundly detrimental (Hawkins et al., 2023). The study examines how rising temperatures and extreme weather events have altered phenological patterns in various regions. These changes are disrupting the synchronization of flowering periods for insects, which has a cascading effect on their life cycles by affecting food availability (Jones et al., 2023). This misalignment between plant-pollinator interactions can lead to reproductive challenges and reduced fitness in many species. Furthermore, the study examines how these impacts may be further intensified due to habitat fragmentation which has led ushered by urbanization (Green et al., 2021). The consequences of climate change on insect biodiversity are not only disrupting ecosystem services but also affect human food production, as it is linked with the decline in arable land and freshwater resources. A lack of genetic diversity within certain species has been observed to be another significant consequence (Patterson et al., 2023). The study concludes by suggesting that insects like butterflies are particularly vulnerable, as their entire life cycles can be altered due to these environmental changes. Insect biodiversity is crucial for pollination and decomposition processes in ecosystems (Fisher et al., 2018).\"\n",

The application must offer an efficient way to delete inappropriate or unwanted content from the user’s timeline, including self-deletion and comment removal functionalities that work across all devices (iOS/Android). Users should be able to remove comments they wish no longer appear on their profile without requiring administrative privileges.\n",
      "5. The application shall provide a feature for saving photos similar to iOS's \"Save Photo\" option, allowing users to bookmark and quickly access favorite images from the news feed or timeline with minimal steps across devices (iOS/Android). \n",
      "6. Integration of notifications that inform about new statuses posted by friends in real-time without intrusive pop-ups while maintaining user privacy settings preferences, including disabling ads and unsolicited content prompts as per the users' choice or system constraints (e.g., battery life considerations).\n",
      "7. The application must ensure that clicking on a picture in someone’s news feed opens up their correct profile photo without loading an incorrect image. Additionally, it should not freeze during daily use and maintain stability post-updates to prevent frequent force closures or network errors when uploading pictures for sharing with friends.\n",
      "8. Users need the ability to view only new photos uploaded by themselves within a 24-hour period on their timeline without having access to older content, ensuring that users are notified of updates and can easily manage visibility settings dynamically according to personal preferences or privacy considerations (e.g., keeping profile pictures visible for friends but hiding from strangers).\n",
      "9. The application should incorporate a dedicated voice input feature within the keyboard interface as an alternative text entry method, allowing users with accessibility needs additional convenience and efficiency in communication without compromising character count limitations imposed by network bandwidth considerations (e.g., avoiding unwarranted data usage spikes).\n",
      "10. The application must be capable of tracking user activity such as calories burned or steps taken via wearable devices like Fitbit flex, syncing this information across platforms and providing encouragement notifications to motivate users towards their fitness goals without compromising battery life significantly (aim for no more than a 25% increase in average device usage).\n",
      "11. Users should have the ability to easily switch between different social media accounts within SocialConnect, with minimal effort required during this transition process and immediate accessibility of friend lists from other platforms upon login without unnecessary prompts or delays (e.g., Facebook friends list visible immediately after logging in through OAuth).\n",
      "12. The application must provide a smooth user experience even on low-end devices by optimizing the UI/UX design for performance, ensuring that all features are responsive and functional across different screen sizes with clear navigation paths to access core functions without experiension of lag or disruinces in connectivity (e.g., no unnecessary delays when sending messages via email).\n",
      "13. The application must support the use of social media accounts from platforms that do not directly integrate OAuth, such as LinkedIn and Twitter with an alternative method for linking these services while ensuring secure authentication methods are also available to minimize forced logout scenarios due to incorrect credentials or expired tokens (e.g., allowing users a maximum of 5 login attempts followed by automatic timeout after which the system prompts re-authentication).\n",
      "14. Users must be able to recover their account if lost, with an easy password recovery process that includes security questions and alternative methods such as email verification or phone number confirmation without excessive time delays (e.g., 2 minutes max for users to submit answers within a secure environment which ensures the accuracy of responses).\n",
      "15. The application should offer customizable notifications, allowing users to filter them based on content type and priority level with options like 'Important', 'Low Priority' or 'Favorite'. This includes enabling push notification delivery preferences (e.g., through email) while still ensuring no more than a 10% increase in data usage during peak times to respect user bandwidth constraints, especially for international users with varying network conditions.\n",
      "16. The application must provide accessibility options such as high contrast themes and the ability to change text size on-the-fly without compromising overall device performance (e.g., no more than a 5% decrease in frame rate). Additionally, it should offer an alternative method for users unable or unwilling to use touch input with minimum of three distinct methods like keyboard navigation, mouse clicks and voice commands that are compatible across all devices including iOS/Android platforms.\n",
      "17. The application must provide comprehensive privacy settings allowing a granular control over who can view specific content on their profile (e.g., friends only or public) along with the ability to delete individual photos from one's timeline without affecting other users’ visibility of these images, ensuring that user profiles are not automatically shared across all devices and platforms upon login while maintaining a seamless transition between accounts for those who switch frequently (e.g., no unsolicited prompts or delays).\n",
      "18. The application should include an offline mode where users can access their news feed without internet connectivity, with the option to sync once they are back online while ensuring minimal data usage and maintaining user experience integrity as per constraints on device memory (e.g., no more than 20MB of additional storage used for temporary cache).\n",
      "19. The application shall provide a feature where users can share photos directly from their smartphones without having to open the app, with an option that allows them to save images locally before sending via email or uploading using third-party cloud services (e.g., Dropbox), ensuring minimal latency in delivery and compatibility across different operating systems while respecting user privacy settings preferences such as disabling unwanted ads without compromising the core functionality of photo sharing among friends within 10 seconds after picture capture or generation, with a maximum data usage increase not exceeding 5% during this process.\n",
      "20. The application must offer an easy-to-use interface for users to navigate through friend lists and suggest potential new connections based on mutual contacts without unnecessary prompts upon login while ensuring the system does not require excessive power consumption (e.g., no more than 15% increase in device battery life).\n",
      "21. The application shall provide a mechanism wherein it auto-remembers frequently used passwords, with security questions as an alternative method for password recovery without compromising user data safety and privacy preferences such that users have the ability to control which friends can see their status updates (e.g., limit visibility based on friendship levels or specific friend requests) while ensuring minimal battery drainage during this process.\n",
      "22. The application must provide a feature wherein clicking directly opens an image with alt-text descriptions for visually impased users without loading incorrect images, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity (e.g., no more than 1% increase in data usage when accessing alternative text features).\n",
      "23. The application shall provide a feature to mark status updates as 'Read' or 'Unread', with the ability for self-deletion of these notifications after viewing, which should not affect other users’ notification settings and must work seamlessly across all devices (e.g., iOS/Android).\n",
      "24. The application shall offer a feature to save favorite photos on timeline that are automatically removed if deemed inappropriate or irrelevant over time without impacting the performance of user's device, ensuring no more than 5% decrease in frame rate and memory usage while maintaining accessibility options such as high contrast themes for visually impainable users.\n",
