    "**NFR Categories:**\n",
    "- Usability (US): How easy the system is to use, learn, and its user interface.\n",
    "- Reliability (RL): The system's ability to perform consistently without failure, its uptime, and data recovery.\n",
    "- Performance (PE): The system's speed, responsiveness, efficiency, throughput, and resource consumption.\n",
    "- Portability (PO): How easily the system can be adapted or moved to different operating environments, platforms, or devices.\n",
    "- Security (SE): Protection of data from unauthorized access, attacks, ensuring privacy and data integrity.\n",
    "- Other (OT): Any review that does not fit clearly into the above specific NFR categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "1. Read the 'User Review' carefully.\n",
    "2. In a brief, step-by-step reasoning, analyze the review. What core concern is the user expressing? Does it relate to ease of use, stability, speed, compatibility, or data protection? Explain your reasoning process.\n",
