We include here references to datasets constructed in related work that were used in our study.
We identified these datasets from a repository sharing replication packages for studies on app review analysis in software engineering: J. DÄ…browski, "Analysing App Reviews for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review", EMSE 2022.

1) User Request Dataset
Paper: Jha and Mahmoud, "Using Frame Semantics for Classifying and Summarizing Application Store Reviews", EMSE 2018
Description: Includes app reviews annotated by type of user feedback (feature requests, bug reports, and others).
